Maze solving program that uses the curses library to display the maze and find the 
shortest path from the starting point ("O") to the ending point ("X"). 
The program uses BFS to find the path.

Example:

# X # # # # # # #
# X             #
# X # #   # #   #
# X #       #   #
# X #   #   #   #
# X #   #   #   #
# X #   #   # # #
# X X X X X X X #
# # # # # # # X #
